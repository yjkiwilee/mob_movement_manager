## 2. Installing the datapack

### 2.1. Singleplayer

  ∟ README.md
```

### 2.2. Multiplayer


Navigate to the server folder and locate the folder of the world you want to install the datapack to (default: `world`). Inside the world folder, locate the `datapacks` folder and copy in the datapack folder inside it.

As a result, the contents of the `datapacks` folder should look like the following:

```
datapacks
∟ mob_movement_manager
  ∟ data
  ∟ pack.mcmeta
